# Antifungal-Peptide-Prediction

<p>For this assignment, we applied the SVM prediction model using the five-fold cross
validation method. We carried out this prediction on various input parameters applied on
the amino acid sequences which are listed as follows:</p>
- Amino Acid Composition
- Dipeptide Composition
- Tripeptide Composition
- Hydrophobicity
<p> We found out that our best score is 0.92717 using the Tripeptide Composition of amino
acid sequences. </p> 
## Execution Information
<p> We implemented our code on the Google Colab Platform. We have submitted the .ipynb
file for the same. Follow the following steps to execute the code: </p>
>- Open colab.research.google.com
>- Open the final_tripeptide_svm.ipynb which is included in the submission.
>- After this, upload the train.csv and test.csv in the root directory of the notebook.
> These files are required by the program to read the IDs, sequences and labels.
- Run the program from Runtime > Run all or using the shortcut Ctrl + F9
- The final output file named tripeptide_svm_pred.csv is generated in the root
directory of the notebook.
